# Note-taking-app
In this project, I will build a note taking app, using the Android Architecture Component libraries (Room, ViewModel, LiveData and LifeCycle), a RecyclerView and Java. 
The data will be stored in an SQLite database and supports insert, read, update and delete operations. 
For this will follow the official recommendations from the "Guide to App Architecture"
